# Undead Split Keyboard (v2)

Undead Split v2 is the second revision of my selfmade split mechanical keyboard.

### Oversights

While the keyboard is fully functional, there are some oversights worth fixing
before printing more PCBs:

 - While the joycon housing is centered with the diodes, the stick is offset;
    the stick is the only thing visible in a case, so it should be centered
